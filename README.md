# bsdgames #
bsdgames sources, primarily for the FreeBSD port games/bsdgames

this is an effort to bring everything up to date, fix some bugs, maybe add some games from the original distribution that are missing in the dragonflybsd distribution.
please see TODO.md for more details.

**any help is highly welcome!!**
